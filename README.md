# Data Science-projects

1) **Sonar(rock or mine)**: Using the sonar dataset, this project aims to employ machine learning algorithms to predict whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signals. By implementing techniques such as logistic regression or random forests, the model seeks to achieve accurate classification, contributing to the development of effective underwater object detection systems
   
2) **Gold price prediction**: Using a historical gold price dataset, this project aims to develop a predictive model for gold prices based on key market indicators and historical trends. Through feature engineering and a regression-based approach, it seeks to provide insights into future gold price fluctuations, aiding investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions

3) **Online Payment Fraud Detection:** This repository contains a set of machine learning models and algorithms designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in online payment systems. It leverages advanced data analysis techniques and anomaly detection to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring secure and reliable online transactions.
